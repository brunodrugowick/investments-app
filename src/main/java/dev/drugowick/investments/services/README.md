# Service Layer

## Profile Service

 

## UserService

The UserService is not implemented because I'm configuring a UserDetailsManager bean with a JdbcUserDetailsManager on the security configurations.

This required the creation of two models: User and Authority. They are separated under security package on the domain layer.
